\textcolor{red}{\underline{\textbf{Direction of the research activities of Marc Moreno Maza's team :}}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Study theoretical aspects of systems of polynomial equations and try to answer the question ``what is the best form for the set of solutions ?''
\item Study algorithmic answers to the question ``how can we compute this form of the set of solutions at the lowest cost ?''
\item Study implementation techniques for algorithms to make the best use of today's computers.
\item Apply it to unsolved problems when the prototype solver is ready.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{\underline{\textbf{Current main purpose of the laboratory :}}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide {\sc Maple}'s end-users with symbolic computation tools.
\item Take advantage of hardware acceleration technologies, using GPUs and multicores, using the best computer ressources.
\item Develop the library \textit{cumodp} which will be integrated into {\sc Maple} so as to provide fast arithmetic operations over prime fields.
\end{itemize}
