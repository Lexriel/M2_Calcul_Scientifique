\begin{itemize}
\item We want to evaluate the following polynomial :
$$P(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i\, X^i = a_0 + a_1\, X + a_2\, X^2 + ... + a_n\, X^n$$

A better way to evaluate it is to use the \textcolor{red}{Horner's method} represented $P$ in the following form :
$$\textcolor{darkgreen}{P(X) = a_0 + X\, \left(a_1 + X\, \left(a_2 + X\,\left(\cdots \left(a_{n-1} + \left(a_n\, X\right)\cdots \right)\right)\right)\right)}$$

\item \underline{\textit{costs of operations :}} $\Theta(n)$ for Horner's method, $\Theta(n^2)$ for naive method.
