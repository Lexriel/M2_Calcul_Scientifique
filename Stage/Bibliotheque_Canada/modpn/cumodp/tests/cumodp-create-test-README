User Instruction for cumodp-create-test(cumodp-create-test.sh)

cumodp-create-test is an automatic script to create specific test to verify the functionality
and correctness in cumodp project. 
The main idea is to extract the test code from the source file and rebuild a test driver code 
to execute a test.
The main idea of the script "cumodp-create-test.sh" is to copy the template called
".test_script.template" to [NAME OF YOUR TEST]
Hence if you want to change the template, please rename it and change the cumodp-create-test.sh,
or, simply let me know. I know it's buggy and ugly. Hence it's pretty welcomed to do so.
If you have any question and suggestions, please feel free to contact me at <jim.jiajian.yang@gmail.com>

Usage:
To create a test, just run:
$ ./cumodp-create-test [NAME OF YOUR TEST]
and you will find a new test script generated in current directory.

And we take an example, say:
[NAME OF YOUR TEST]=list_stockham

So we create the test first:
$./cumodp-create-test list_stockham
Then we will find a new file called list_stockham.sh in the directory.

We will change the related fields to make the test running properly:
1. Get into your list_stockham.sh
2. Change the description of your test in the first line
3. Change the author field, hence we could acknowledge your contribution :)
4. Set TARGET="list_stockham"
5. In the source file of your test, here is ../src/list_stockham.cu , 
   add the flag before your test code start:
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	//BEGIN:list_stockham_tst
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	void list_stockham_tst(bla bla bla bla parameters){
		..................your test code..........................
6. At the end of the test function list_stockham_tst() also add the flag:
		..................your test code..........................
	}
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	//END:list_stockham_tst
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
7. Then go back to your list_stockham.sh, change the field of "include files"
	as you want. Remember to redirect the code lines you input to the test source code,
	here is "src.cu". You will find it easy.
8. Well then change your main function in it, it's easy for you to change the parameters.
	You know what I'm saying right?
9. Remember to check the $(CC) field, because sometimes we want gcc and sometimes nvcc.
10. Start changing your way of test your function in the later fields. For example, change
	the dimension of your parameters.
11. I would recommend you redirect your console output to a text file. You could see how I did
	all these. I hate tons of console output of my screen. Yes it looks very geeky, but trust
	me the best way to check if your result is correct is to put it into a log file. Here I set
	TWO places for you to put your log. One is called "$LOG" is to place the test results, say
	the marks of each test, pass or fail. The other is to record the console output called "$OUT".
	$OUT file might be mass. You have to check it just for the failed tests.
12. After everything is done, the script will clean up the temporary source file src.cu.
