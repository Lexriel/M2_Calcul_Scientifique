optimized_mult.sh
------------------
o Make w (= the # of coefficients per thread
    and B the # of threads in a thread block) 
  optional arguments
o Run each caculation 10 times and retunn the average time

stockham_poly_mul.sh
--------------------
      OK


subproduct_tree_construction.sh
--------------------------------
1/ Input: n // the number of points
          p //  prime number
          points are random and pairwise different
    Output:  the subproduct tree stays  on the GPU
    On the screen, we have
    n      t      s
    2^23   3,14   

    where s is the space in bytes for the subproduct tree data structure
2/ Allow n to be a range 2..24

  !!!!!!!! Size=2^25,  is not working properly
     ===> Anis will have a look


subproduct_tree_step.sh
------------------------

     !!!!!! OK
